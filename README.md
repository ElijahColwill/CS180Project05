The project centers around creating a social network with users creating Profiles displaying information such as contact information and  
hobbies and interests, as well as a Friends system with the capacity to send, view, and accept/deny requests.

- Ability to create, edit and delete Users and Profiles. A User can only edit their own Profile.
- Implementation of GUI for all user interactions and error handling.
- Implementation of Concurrency in the Server to handle multiple users.
- Friend Request System between users with the abiity to view Friends List, and send/recieve/view/accept/deny requests.
